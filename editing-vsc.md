Use this [guide to basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), if desired.

In the above image, we bolded the word Abstract with two astericks on either side of the word. 
We also created a hyperlink to the presentation using the common syntax of the visible text in square brackets with the URL following it in rounded brackets.

## Commiting changes in VSC

There are 3 options for commiting:
1. **Commit**: Saves changes to your local machine
2. **Commit & Push**: Saves chagnes to your local machine and pushes to your remote repository.
3. **Commit & Sync**: Saves changes to your local machine, pulls from your remote repository, and then pushes to your remote repository.



Commit will simply make record of your changes that you have made on your local machine. It will not mark the change in the remote repository.
Commit and Push will do the above and push it to the remote repository. This means that any changes you have made will be saved to the remote repository as well.
Commit and Sync does three things. First, it will commit. Second, it will perform a pull (grabs the updated information from the remote repo). Finally, it will push.
