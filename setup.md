## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a free coding editor created by Microsoft. 

You can download the Stable or Insiders version of the software for Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems. The Insiders version includes the latest code pushes by developers of Visual Studio Code, and is more suitable for those at a more advanced level. If you are a **beginner**, please download the stable version of Visual Studio Code for your operating system.
