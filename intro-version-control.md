# Introduction to Version Control

## Recording the history of your projects
### What is version control?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## Question?
How do you record the history of your projects?

### Bad - Run on file names

### Good - Informatively named files

## Better - Saving everything together at once

Everytime you make a save, you zip the entire directory that your project files are in and save it with a date.

## Best - Version Control

## How does a version control system work?
- Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save just the changes you made at each step of the way.
- You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.

- You can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document.

## Git and Github
Git and GitHub are <b>not the same thing</b>. 
- Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; 
- GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git.<br>
