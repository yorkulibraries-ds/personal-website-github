# Creating a personal website with GitHub Pages

## About GitHub Pages
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) is a free service that allows you to host a website directly from a Github.com repository. It's a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and Javascript files directly from your Github.com repository and publishes the website.


## Setting up GitHub Pages using the academicpages template
Creating a GitHub Pages site is a straightforward process: Create a repository, make sure your repository name is `<user>.github.io` and then configure your Pages under the Settings tab of that repository. [Full instructions are available here.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

However, in this workshop, we don't want to create a GitHub Pages site from scratch. We want to save time and energy by using a template. There are many templates for GitHub Pages available out there, but today we will be using the [academicpages template](https://academicpages.github.io/) since it is meant specifically for personal academic websites!
