# Module 1: Increasing Your Scholarly Presence Online
Why is this important - etc
## Scholarly Visibility and You
Internet is big; lots of new scholars out there today
Now more than ever, you need to create a space to differentiate yourself from other scholars online

Making Your Research and Scholarly Outputs Visible and Accessible can:
- Increase your chances of being noticed by other scholars in your field and in other disciplines
- Improve the likelihood that your work is used and cited by other scholars
- Improve your scholarly reputation

### Strategies for Increasing Scholarly Visibility:
1. Create a personal website outlining all your academic work (what we're doing today!)
2. Deposit published or unpublished work into a subject-based or institutional repository, such as [YorkSpace](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/)
3. Create an ORCID-iD.
4. Publish Open Access and license OA works under a Creative Commons license. 
5. Increase your social media presence online.

#### Increase Social Media Presence
Mastodon and Twitter

“Remember: All social media posts are a form of publication. If you would not write it in an academic review, don’t blog about it or post it on Twitter or Facebook” (Cain, 2017). 

Online platforms are a source of inspiration, discovery, and delight, but they can also be a forum for hate, negativity, and exclusion. Do your part to ensure that you are contributing positively to the discourse. 

Consider -  is the content that you are creating, sharing, or contributing to:

At least mostly relevant or of interest to your desired audience?
Reflective of your personal (and/or professional) values and ethics?
Something you would be happy for a potential collaborator, grant administrator, or current student to see? 
The answer to all of these questions should be a vehement “yes.”
