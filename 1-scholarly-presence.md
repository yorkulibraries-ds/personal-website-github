# Module 1: Increasing Your Scholarly Presence Online

## Scholarly Visibility and You
As vast quantities of research and scholarly work are published online, many researchers and scholars often wonder how they will stand out amongst the crowd. The scholarly visibility tips and tricks below can help to distinguish yourself and improve the reach of your work.

Making Your Research and Scholarly Outputs Visible and Accessible can:
- Increase your chances of being noticed by other scholars in your field and in other disciplines
- Improve the likelihood that your work is used and cited by other scholars
- Improve your scholarly reputation

Important Considerations:
- What do you hope to gain by improving your visibility online? (i.e., find collaborators, find a job)
- Who do you want to engage with?
- How much information do you want to share?
- How much time do you have to develop an online presence?

### Strategies for Increasing Scholarly Visibility:
1. Create a personal website outlining all your academic work (what we're doing today!)
2. Deposit published or unpublished work into a subject-based or institutional repository, such as [YorkSpace](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/)
3. Create an ORCID-iD.
4. Publish Open Access and license OA works under a Creative Commons license. 
5. Increase your social media presence online.

#### Institutional/Subject Based Repositories
Repositories are great places to both **preserve** and **disseminate** your scholarly work. 

There are two main types of repositories:
- Institutional repositories, such as [YorkSpace](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/)
- Subject-based pre-print repositories, such as [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) or [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv).

If you are a staff, faculty, librarian, and/or researcher affiliated with York University, you can submit works to YorkSpace using our [Mediated Deposit Service](https://scottlibrary.apps01.yorku.ca/machform/view.php?id=117372). Simply fill out the form and attach your **Author-Accepted Manuscript** (i.e., the version after peer-review but before publisher typesetting) to get started.

Some of the benefits of depositing work to YorkSpace include: 
- Long-term preservation of your scholarly work  
- A permanent unique Handle (similar to a DOI), that can be linked to your online platforms and CV 
- All items in YorkSpace are harvested by Google Scholar, which increases the discoverability of your work. 

#### ORCID-iD
- Free, unique, 16-digit persistent identifier for researchers engaging scholarly activities
- The most effective way to prevent name ambiguity between yourself and other researchers 
- Increasingly required by publishers and funding agencies

#### Open Access Publishing
>Open access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. -- Peter Suber, [Open Access](https://openaccesseks.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/6y6fc8k5/release/2), p.4

How does publishing OA benefit authors?
- Increases the discoverability of research, enhancing impact
- Greater control over published works
- Eases sharing and reuse amongst students and colleagues
- Depositing a version of a work in an open access repository guarantees long term preservation

How does OA publishing support the community?
- Accelerates discovery/improves education
- Equitable access to research
- Increases transparency and accountability 

York University Libraries continues to fund Open Access publishing through various agreements with publishers and memberships and funding commitments. See our [Investments in Open Access Publishing](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/research-learn/research/oapublishing/investments-in-open-access-publishing/) page to learn more.

#### Creative Commons Licensing
- Creative Commons is a non-profit organization with goal of making sharing of works and reuse and/or remixing of other works easier
- Creative Commons licenses provide clear terms of sharing and reuse 
- Attribution 4.0 License (or CC-BY) is the most commonly applied CC license for articles.

#### Increase Social Media Presence
Social media (particularly Twitter and Mastodon) can be excellent places to share your research and interact with other academics in your field of research.

##### Use Social Media with Caution

>“Remember: All social media posts are a form of publication. If you would not write it in an academic review, don’t blog about it or post it on Twitter or Facebook” (Cain, 2017). 

Social media continues to be a source of inspiration and connection for many, but can also provide a platform for hate and negative discourse. Make sure you are using your platform as an academic responsibly. 

Consider whether your content acheives the following goals:
- Is it relevant for your audience?
- Does your content reflect your values?
- Would you feel comfortable sharing this content with a potential collaborator, a grant administrator, or a current student?

## Why Create a Website on GitHub?
- GitHub is cloud-based, which means you can edit your website from anywhere

- GitHub pages uses Git and GitHub, which provide robust version control management. You can always roll back to a previous version of your page if you're not happy with content or layout.
- GitHub is made for collaborative work, so you can develop a website as a team.
